The '''Nazi Lowriders''' are a [[criminal syndicate]] and a '''Lowrider Car Club''' that are based in [[Southern California]] and are active only in [[Southern California]]. '''Nazi Lowriders''' are also known collectively as '''The NLR''' and are also collectively known as '''The Ride''' of '''Nazi Lowriders'''.

==Origins of The Nazi Lowriders==
The '''Nazi Lowriders''' were formed in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] in the late [[1960s]] as a gang of members who owned [[Chevy]] [[Lowrider]] vehicles with origins in the Southern California [[Lowrider]] [[Car Culture]] Community. They were first documented by U.S. Law
Enforcement authorities on the border of [[East Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] and in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] in the mid [[1970s]].

The name of the gang was originally a play on words on rival [[Hispanic]] Car Clubs as being the most '''Racially Pure''' of the '''Hispanic Car Clubs''' in '''Southern California''' as the gang fought their enemy '''Hispanic Lowrider Gangs''' and overcame their rival '''Hispanic Lowrider Gangs''' in Southern California. The [[Law of the United States|U.S. Legal System]] that was constructed and formed in Southern California throughout the [[1950s]] by invading [[Non-Hispanic White]] [[Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States|Population Groups]] into Southern California favored the racially pure over all other ethnic groups. The Nazi Lowriders did not start as a [[Neo-Nazi]] Gang, they started as a Hispanic Lowrider Car Club.

Nazi Lowriders formed their own [[Prison Gang]] in Southern California in the late [[1970s]] as they were incarcerated for street crimes and they later in [[1997]] formed a small temporary alliance with the original members of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] of [[Southern California]] after the 11 year old biological son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club spoke to a high ranking boss of the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] and later as a 13 year old he spoke to a captain of the [[Hells Angels|Hells Angels Motorcycle Club]] as the Nazi Lowriders gained more membership, but not from the '''Hells Angels'''. It was later revealed that the [[U.S. Navy]] was surveilling that [[Sinaloa Cartel]] Boss' residence before and after these visits and discussions.

The '''Hells Angels''' of Southern California had discussed either buying the name of this Car Club or temporarily change alliances. The son of the founder of the Nazi Lowriders decided to temporarily add alliances to the Nazi Lowrider Car Club for the fate of several small towns in [[Southern California]] where enemy groups wanted to sell off pieces of California to the enemies of California who were not from California. The founder of the Nazi Lowriders Car Club and his biological son have admitted to being anti-Italian, anti-Irish and against the immigration of several different ethnic population groups into Southern California namely from Southern Non-Hispanic White population groups because the Nazi Lowriders are part [[Hispanic]] and because the Nazi Lowriders are descended multi-generationally from California. Citing the partial Mexican-Hispanic ethnicity of [[Edward Furlong]]. Instead he decided to form a temporary alliance with the existing population groups in Southern California having already been a longtime ally of several different [[Chicano]] and [[Chicana]] Car Clubs in Southern California as well as of the [[Chicanos]].

The '''Nazi Lowrider''' [[Car Club]] and the '''Nazi Lowrider''' [[Prison Gang]] are the same and these entities were not founded by [[John Stinson]] or by the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and in fact the '''Nazi Lowriders''' existed in Southern California long before the founding of the '''Aryan Brotherhood''' in [[Southern California]]. Originally, the Nazi Lowriders were formed as a White-Hispanic Car Club of Southern California in the late [[1960s]] and the [[1970s]].

Collected verifiable media and verifiable video footage in Southern California namely from [[Lowrider Magazine]] of Southern California as well as from video news reports from [[KTLA|Video News Reporting Agencies]] in '''Los Angeles, Southern California''' show the '''Nazi Lowriders''' in '''street races''' near [[Boyle Heights]] in [[East Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] in the early [[1990s]] as well as in Super Sport '''Lowrider Car Shows''' in [[Central Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] and near [[West Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] in the mid [[1990s]] to the mid [[2000s]].

===History of Waves of Immigration Into California and The Formation of Street Gangs===
[[Non-Hispanic White]] [[street gangs]] and [[African-American]] [[street gangs]] did not actually exist in Southern California before or during the arrival of Non-Hispanic Whites and [[African-Americans]] into [[Southern California]] and the waves of immigration of Non-Hispanic Whites into [[Southern California]] from the [[1920s]] to the [[1960s]]. The town of [[Compton]], in Southern California was originally a Non-Hispanic White neighborhood from the [[1940s]] to the late [[1960s]] before it became incorporated into the [[County of Los Angeles]] afterwhich a wave of [[African-Americans]] moved in and slowly overtook the area and were visibly seen as a street gang known as the '''Cripps''' which is a word that is usually shortened to [[Crips]] where then after the formation of the '''Cripps''' the '''Bloods''' then began as a new branch of the '''Cripps''' that also visibly showed a force in these areas throughout the 1980s. During the immigration of [[African-Americans]] into [[Compton]], [[Southern California]] they were segregated to their own side of this town that were collectively called '''The Pits''' and '''The Slums''' of '''Compton''' until they overtook the entire town to the border of the city of [[South Gate]], [[Southern California]] throughout the [[1980s]] and into the [[1990s]]. Primary immigration of the [[African-American]] population groups into these areas in [[Southern California]] come from the U.S. State of [[Louisiana]] from the [[1970s]] to the [[1990s]].

The '''Bloods''' were originally a cultural part of the '''Cripps'''. The '''Cripps''' were slowly forced to move away from [[Compton]], [[Los Angeles]] in [[Southern California]] throughout the late [[1990s]] to the early to mid [[2000s]] while they were at occupational war with invading enemy Hispanic gangs. The '''Cripps''' gang were founded by [[Hispanics]] before they began recruiting African-Americans in the [[1970s]]. In the late [[1990s]] it was revealed to the rest of the Los Angeles [[gangland]] that the '''Cripps''' were in fact formed by Hispanics while they used African-American gang members as a visible and showable force.

The primary waves of immigration of Non-Hispanic Whites into [[Southern California]] began after the [[1930s]] and included numerous waves of immigration of Non-Hispanic Whites from the Southern-Central United States namely from [[Oklahoma]] and affected areas of the [[Dust Bowl]]. California State Law was previously ennacted from the [[1930s]] to the [[1950s]] to illegalize the immigration of any '''Americans''' from other U.S. States into California and [[Spanish California]] did not actually end socially until the early [[1900s]]. Every U.S. State west of the [[New England]] Colony States became a recognized and ratified U.S. State after the early to mid [[1900s]]. [[Oklahoma]] State for instance was not actually a recognized and ratified U.S. State until after [[1920]] because it was still called [[Indian Territory]] while the U.S. maintained efforts of colonizing [[Indian Territory]] and everything west of [[Indian Territory]] by [[White]] [[Settlers]].

The U.S. [[Social Security Number]] was not introduced to [[U.S. Citizens]] until the mid [[1930s]] and the program was not widely forced into the U.S. population until the 1950s. The [[Dust Bowl]] of the areas of [[Oklahoma]] brought waves of surviving [[American Indians]] as well as [[Non-Hispanic Whites]] from the areas known as [[Indian Territory]] into [[Southern California]] beginning in the mid [[1930s]]. While the U.S. encouraged expansion and settling in and further west of [[Indian Territory]] most of California safeguarded its territorial borders and restricted immigration from other U.S. territories. The dominating social force in '''California''' was known as the '''Californias''' and [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] was still lived in primarily by South-Western American Indian Tribes that lived in and traveled in bands. Most American Indians of the South West moved away to areas in México after battling with the U.S. Military Forces in the early [[1900s]] before regaining their land and establishing treaties with the U.S. Government throughout the [[1970s]].

[[Italians]] and [[Italian-Americans]] did not actually begin waves of immigration into California until after the [[1950s]] and the migration of the affected of the [[Dust Bowl]] did not have any Italian population groups because the U.S. government did not allow Italians or Italian-Americans to claim any land in the [[Oklahoma Land Rush]] or in any [[Indian Territory]] because none of them fought in any of the wars for U.S. President [[Andrew Jackson]], and war participation was required in order to apply for and secure land ownership in Indian Territory by those White European Settlers.

In military terminology [[Occupation]] refers to [[agenda|agendized]] groups of people who literally move into the houses in the area or else into the area in order to take over the area while they go to war with the local population groups, kill them off and then move more allies into that area in order to own that area in every way possible.

The primary waves of concentrated illegal immigration of Non-Latino Slav ( [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Eastern Europeans]] ) and Latino-Slav as well as [[Armenians]] into Southern California did not actually begin until the early to mid [[2000s]] as they began colonizing areas in [[Central America]] and [[South America]] and began traveling north to the borders of the U.S. and México to then illegally enter into Southern California.

The original [[Californians]] were known as the [[Californianos]] and the [[Californianas]] who had multi-generational ancestral descent from the Spanish Empire in the [[Californias]].

The original American Indians in the areas that are now known as California were the American Indigenous People who lived all throughout the easily accessible areas of what is now known as California because they did not have access to
horses or carriages and no roads existed for them travel long distance. They were mostly concentrated along the coastal areas of California where there were easily accessible fishing. Horses were not actually brought into the Pacific Americas en mass until after the 18th century where they then bred Spanish horses and ponies in California.

Waves of immigration of [[Central Americans]] and [[South Americans]] into [[California]] did not actually begin until the [[1960s]], but some of these population groups existed in California in small numbers. While [[Latinos]] and [[Latinas]] can claim American Indigenous heritage because they descend ancestrally from Indigenous groups of [[Central America]] and [[South America]] they cannot claim to have been in [[California]] before the [[1850s]] because there were no means to transport them in large groups even by Spanish ships that sailed the Pacific Coastlines. Instead the Spanish put to work the Indigenous of the areas of what is now known as Northern México.

Nearly every gang in California was formed together and is held together by [[ethnic]] and [[racial group]] [[sameness]].

===History and Origins In The Southern California Hispanic Lowrider Car Culture===
The phrase: '''Nazi Lowrider''' is a phrase that was [[coined]] by the founder of this [[Car Club]] as members of this [[Car Club]] went to war with their enemy gangs notably the gang known as the '''Cripps''' which is a word that is usually shortened to the word [[Crips]] and is a [[gang]] that was and is exclusively based in Southern California. The '''Nazi Lowriders''' also went to war with the '''Cripp''' counterpart gangs that are known as the [[Bloods]] all throughout the [[1980s]] in Southern California and later they went to war with the ''Cripp'' owned '''Car Club''' collectively known as the [[Druid Car Club]] all throughout the [[1990s]] and the early to mid [[2000s]]. Many of the original '''Cripp''' gang members were part [[Hispanic]] and or mixed with [[Hispanic]] and [[African]] heritage whereas the members of the '''Nazi Lowriders''' were more racially pure than all others out of all of the '''Lowrider Car Clubs''' in Southern California, hence the phrase: '''Nazi Lowrider'''.

The '''Nazi Lowriders''' became known as pioneers of street craft in Southern California Gangland as they allied with Sureños groups. Street craft includes killing enemies by drive-by gunfire and then disposing of the bodies
by placing the body into a metal barrel and then by dumping the body into a water canal where the water would slowly dissolve the body into bones over 1 year of flowing water through the canal.

The '''Cripps''' later formed more alliances with the '''Latin-American''' community in Southern California whereas the '''Nazi Lowriders''' formed more alliances with the existing [[Non-Hispanic White]] communities in Southern California and the existing [[White-Hispanic]] communities in Southern California.

The words [[Latino]] and [[Latina]] refer to people with Latin-American heritage. Latin-American countries are all of the countries that are south of the country of [[México]]. While [[Méxicans]] can be considered [[Hispanic]] because they speak a dialect of the language of [[Spanish]] not all [[Méxican]] [[Citizens]] or [[Méxican]] [[Nationals]] have origins from the country of [[México]] and many Méxicans have both [[American]] [[Indigenous]] and [[Spanish]] ( From [[Spain]] ) heritage whereas [[Californianos]] and [[Californianas]] which are technically multi-generational Californians and are people that descend from the era of [[Spanish California]]. [[Chicanos]] and [[Chicanas]] are a completely different Hispanic group.

===Unique Contributions To The Lowrider Car Culture of Southern California===
The founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club can be seen with his biological son and his wife in their unique Lowrider vehicle in the [[1990]], [[1991]] issues of [[Lowrider Magazine]] of [[Southern California]].

'''Nazi Lowriders''' contributed significant advancements to the '''Lowrider Car Culture''' of Southern California most notably the extended hydraulic suspension engineering schemes where some of their lowrider cars could extend up to 25 feet or more into the air where members could jump through second-story hotel and motel windows to fight enemies as well as to collect money and '''Nazi Lowrider' Lowriders''' that were seen between the [[1980s]] and the [[1990s]] were extremely unique. They also wrote advanced custom [[web application]] [[software]] from the late [[1990s]] to the mid [[2000s]] that could run from any [[Internet]] [[Web Browser]] where that web application software would automatically resize itself to any electronic device display resolution including from low budget and quickly disposable mobile cell phone devices where any of the members could send messages to all members at the same time as well as to any other member specifically to request pick up anywhere including by [[G.P.S. Location]], quickly send orders, make [[VoIP]] phone calls, sell cannabis drug products and more. This was extremely useful for members to communicate long distance where S.M.S., M.M.S. and early publicly accessible [[social media]] platforms limited communication speed while traveling with a mobile electronic cell phone or a mobile electronic laptop or notebook computer. This ennabled members to compete with and defeat all enemy gangs in Southern California. The web application software was also very useful for '''Nazi Lowriders''' who traveled in groups through [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] and [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]]. Copies of this software were given to the allies of the '''Nazi Lowriders''' where the allies then continued development of it into their own versions.

===Nazi Lowrider Software===
The [[Vagos Motorcycle Club]] were known to have developed a version of this web application software where it could compete with the Meta Smart Glasses Platform.

From [[2020]] to [[2025]] the [[Nazi Lowriders]] spent another $40,000 developing a new base version of this web application software that is based on the original web application software programming code logic and it is now a fully featured and privately accessible social media platform where all members of the [[Nazi Lowriders]] can communicate in mass with each other long distance anywhere they are at instantly. This web application software supports all newly released [[smart glasses]] with live voice and video transmission directly to the member profile along with encrypted voice and video communication directly from the smart glasses. The software also tracks every lowrider and every electronic device connected to it that has a G.P.S. chip built in at intervals of every 2 seconds. Every 2 seconds of movement of the lowrider and every electronic device that is connected to it is logged to the unique member profile with [[Latitude]], [[Longitude]], [[Altitude]]-To-Sea-Level and device sensor coordinates down to a radius of 3 - 7 feet where every vehicle and electronic device can also be traced by every other Nazi Lowrider step-by-step every 2 seconds in a 24 hour log file.

The [[Nazi Lowriders]] also spent another $60,000 on a different project developing a specialized lowrider racing vehicle with advanced hydraulics and nitro cooling systems capable of 24/7 live video recording from the vehicle dash, vechile mirrors, vehicle rear and with 360 degree rotation of the cameras controllable from the stearing column of the vehicle. This specialized lowrider vehicle is capable of sending up to 720 Gigabytes of video data at 4K video resolution at 24 hours per day at 5g LTE internet connection speed to the private web server that has their custom web application software installed on. This lowrider racing vehicle was documented with costs of custom engineering, vehicle part customizations, paint jobs, metal reinforcement and more.

In demonstrations this web application software can support up to ~200 concurrent and unique network connections on a shared hosting web server, up to ~300 concurrent and unique network connections on a remote dedicated web server, up to ~500 concurrent and unique network connections on a private and dedicated web server and up to ~1,000 concurrent and unique network connections on 2 or more private and dedicated web servers in parallel.

The web application can be securely accessed with a set of customized mobile cell phones that run a mobile Linux Operating Sytem known as [[Arch Linux]], [[KDE Plasma Linux Mobile]] and others. The mobile cell phones fit into a
custom machined aluminum case that is bulletproof up to .22 caliber, fireproof, waterproof up to 250m, dustproof, shatterproof. The security harded mobile cell phone can be instantly attached to the dash of the vehicle upon entering
the vehicle where it can be quickly recharged. The customized Nazi Lowrider smart glasses are capable of wirelessly tethering to the mobile cell phone device.

===Banishment of Lowrider Vehicles===
In the [[1990s]] and in the early [[2000s]] in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] as well as in different cities in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] numerous city officials within these counties banned '''Lowrider Racing Vehicles''' with [[hydraulics]] because the lowrider gangs could easily beat all of the [[Law Enforcement]] and the [[Military]] everywhere in [[California]] by using those engineered lowrider vehicles. Law Enforcement could not keep up with the speed of the '''Lowrider Racing Vehicles with Hydraulics''' and no one could hide from the [[maneuverability]] of those vehicles. Some '''Nazi Lowriders''' were known to have extended suspension hydraulics that could not be mimicked by other lowrider gangs where the entire vehicle could be raised sometimes up to 25 feet or more into the air with hydraulics as well as to tactically shield from enemy gun fire.

=Membership Requirements=
The original '''Nazi Lowriders''' required members to know and speak [[Spanish]], prove specific and [[rare]] [[Hispanic]] [[ancestral]] [[heritage]], but no [[Latin American]] heritage and no [[Negroid]] heritage. People with any [[Latin-American]] heritage were not allowed membership in the '''Nazi Lowrider Car Club''' or the '''Nazi Lowrider Prison Gang'''. The Nazi Lowriders later officially recognized several part Latino and Latina members. '''Nazi Lowriders''' also required members to own a specific [[Chevy]] [[Vehicle]] with or without [[hydraulics]]. Lowrider Chevy vehicles were required in order to beat all of the street-level gangs who roamed the streets without vehicles as well as to beat all of the enemy and rival Lowrider gangs. Members were also required to own a hand gun so that member could engage in drive by shootings on their enemies from their lowrider vehicle. Hydraulics were later necessary in order to beat all of the enemies that hid in motels and hotels in Southern California as well as to tactically defend against gun fire from enemy gangs. Chevy vehicles that were manufactured between the 1960s to the late 1970s had extremely tough and high quality metals where [[.22]] [[caliber]] and [[.40]] [[caliber]] rounds could not penetrate through the metals if the vehicle doors and vehicle frames were reinforced with bullet proof goop and bullet proof mechanisms.

=Power Struggles Within The Nazi Lowriders=
After 1997 and after the interaction between the son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club and a high ranking boss of the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] the Nazi Lowriders experienced internal power struggles within their organization as one of their senior members began efforts of recruiting Non-Hispanic Whites into the Nazi Lowrider Car Club. Senior membership of the Nazi Lowriders opposed the recruitment efforts because the Nazi Lowriders have origins in the Hispanic Lowrider Car Community of Los Angeles, Southern California. The [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and the [[Hells Angels]] began recruiting numerous members into the '''Aryan Brotherhood''' and the '''Hells Angels''' through the initiation of Non-Hispanic White recruits from [[Central California]] and in [[Southern California]] mostly from the areas of [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]]. The '''Aryan Brotherhood''' and the '''Hells Angels''' are known to be connected
to Non-Hispanic White Law Enforcement that cover up their crimes.

In the U.S. State of California, English and Spanish are the primary languages. In the U.S. State of Hawaii English, Hawaiian and Japanese are the primary languages. In the U.S. States that border Eastern-Canada English and French
are the primary languages.

In California the primarily spoken languages are English and Spanish because California was formerly owned by the [[Spanish Empire]] where it originally extended down to the areas now known as México. California was purchased
by the expanding U.S. population and California feeds the entire U.S. population because California can grow food crops 365 days a year without any crop freeze. No other area in the U.S. is capable of this and these are some of the reasons why the U.S. Government wants complete control of California. The U.S. Government mission is to expell all Hispanics, Indigenous and the world of Hispania from California so that Non-Hispanic Whites can move in and take everything.

The Nazi Lowriders have strong ties with several [[Chicano]] Car Clubs and their original missions were to protect all family in the Nazi Lowrider Car Club and all of their families in [[California]] as well as to preserve the culture of their Car Club in [[Southern California]] and to defend their streets and areas in [[Southern California]] from their enemies. The original Nazi Lowrider Car Club as well as the Chicano Car Club opposed the waves of [[Non-Hispanic White]] immigration into [[California]] because these population groups take away from all of the resources and they are not from [[California]]. [[California]] belongs to the population groups that are multi-generationally descended from California. These population groups would be [[Indigenous]] who are multi-generationally descended from California, Mestizo who are multi-generationally descended from California, Chicano who are multi-generationally descended from California, Hispanics who are multi-generationally descended from California and anyone else who is multi-generationally descended from California, but not to anyone else. These privileges were later extended to the multi-generationally
descended from the immigration of the affected of the '''Dust Bowl''' from [[Oklahoma]] into [[Southern California]] from the [[1930s]] who were forced to live in the California Concentration Camps, but not to anyone else. Because the '''Dust Bowl''' only affected certain areas of Oklahoma and it did not affect any other areas in the U.S.. The Nazi Lowriders and the Chicanos have fully documented and proven the fraud of the U.S. Government as the U.S. Government have slowly changed U.S. Government maintained records on their end to be more consistent in lies so they can slowly take complete ownership of California by creating fictitious legal rights. These records include changed details in newspaper clippings, changed news reports, changed migration records, including fraudulent and completely made up histories created by the U.S. Government and its controlled churches, changed census records and more.

===Power Differences In The Aryan Brotherhood and The Hells Angels===
The '''Aryan Brotherhood''' and the '''Hells Angels''' were known to have made connections with different [[Italian Criminal Families]] in [[California]] and later with [[Irish Criminal Families]] abroad. Being a primarily [[Hispanic]] and [[White Hispanic]] car club, the Nazi Lowriders experienced internal power struggles to maintain peace with some of these [[Non-Hispanic White]] population groups.
Initially the [[Nazi Lowriders]] had stronger connections with the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] of [[Southern California]] because its members were primarily part [[Hispanic]] whereas the '''Aryan Brotherhood''' and the '''Hells Angels''' are [[Non-Hispanic White]]. In fact, the '''Aryan Brotherhood''' and the '''Hells Angels''' do not actually recruit anyone who is not of pure White Ethnicity.

===Sinaloa Cartel===
The Sinaloa Cartel is divided into several families of direct multi-generational descent from [[Sinaloa]], [[México]] in [[California]]. Membership in the Sinaloa Cartel requires provable ancestral descent from [[Sinaloa]], [[México]].
All real Sureños, Sureñas and Norteños, Norteñas have direct multi-generational descent from [[Sinaloa]], [[México]]. Anyone claiming to be a Sureño, Sureña or a Norteño, Norteña who does not have verifiable multi-generational
descent from [[Sinaloa]], [[México]] is a fraud.

=Connections=
Nazi Lowriders are known to have connections with [[motorcycle clubs]] [[Vagos Motorcycle Club|Vagos Motorcycle Club]] of [[Southern California]] and [[Hells Angels Motorcycle Club|Hells Angels Motorcycle Club]] of [[Southern California]].

The Vagos Motorcycle Club were originally an all Hispanic Motorcycle Club because the word '''Vagos''' in the language of Spanish translates to '''Traveling Gypsy''' and '''Vagabond''' in the language of English.

=Gentrification of Cities In Southern California=
Nazi Lowriders assisted in the [[gentrification]] of several cities in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] as well as of several cities in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]]. Notably [[Oildale]], [[Southern California]] and [[East Bakersfield]], [[Southern California]] in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] throughout the [[1980s]] and the early to mid [[1990s]] as well as several cities in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] notably [[South Gate]], [[Southern California]]. Nazi Lowriders assisted in these gentrifications and advancements because it was worth money. The Nazi Lowriders did not start as a [[Neo-Nazi]] gang, but it became known as one as it allied with a few Non-Hispanic White gangs of [[Southern California]] after [[1996]].

The film [[American History X]] was inspired by the stories of gentrification of [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]] and of [[Compton]], [[Southern California]] by a few fictitious Non-Hispanic White families shown in the film where elements of that fictitious family were based on real families residing in [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]] because [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]] is only ~10 miles south of [[Compton]], [[Southern California]], but it was actually the Nazi Lowriders that helped pave the way for the Non-Hispanic Whites to move into [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]] throughout the [[1990s]] and like [[Edward Furlong]] that real family is part [[Hispanic]].

===Kern County, Southern California===
* [[Oildale]], [[Southern California]]
''The Nazi Lowriders are known to have helped gentrify the town of [[Oildale]], [[Southern California]] and have formed several gang alliances here throughout the [[1990s]]''.

===Los Angeles County, Southern California===
* [[South Gate]], [[Southern California]]
''The Nazi Lowriders are known to have helped gentrify the town of [[South Gate]], [[Southern California]]'' throughout the [[1990s]].

=Street Wars=
Nazi Lowriders have been seen in numerous street battles throughout [[Southern California]] noticed from the [[1970s]] and onward.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Cripps===
Nazi Lowriders are known to have gone to war with the [[Cripps]] of [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and of [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] throughout the [[1980s]] and the early to mid [[1990s]] where there were numerous responses to these incidents, combats and altercations covered by [[Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] news stations and [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] news stations. The son of the founder of the '''Nazi Lowrider Car Club''' was taken away by [[Officers]] of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] as a baby in Downtown Los Angeles, Southern California in ~1988 after Cripps gang members fired several rounds into his father's lowrider vehicle in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] while he was seated in the passenger seat. Gunfire was returned by the Nazi Lowriders and law enforcement and the local news station responded to the incident. The child was placed in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] [[Child Protective Custody]].

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Northern Sinaloa Cartel===
Nazi Lowriders are known to have been in and have been seen in several shootouts with the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] in and around the city of [[South Gate]] in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] throughout the [[1980s]] and the [[1990s]] over different disputes where news stations have responded to these incidents.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Norteños===
Nazi Lowriders were known to have battled [[Norteños]] in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] where news stations have responded to these incidents. The altercations ended in several truces with the Norteño gangs. And
several other truces were made between the Nazi Lowriders and different Norteños and Norteñas on the basis of a romantic relationship between the child son of the founder of the Nazi Lowriders and a female Sureña.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Tijuana Mexican Cartel===
Nazi Lowriders were allied with the [[Sureños]] of [[Kern County]] in [[Southern California]] when they battled the [[Tijuana Mexican Cartel]] in the late 1990s.

====Spark of The Wars Between The Nazi Lowriders and The Tijuana Mexican Cartel====
The son of one of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club was repeatedly drugged and sexually molested by a Non-Black [[Hispanic]] [[female]] member of the [[Crips]] who also had membership in the [[Tijuana Mexican Cartel]] which is also known as the [[Tijuana Cartel]] and who targeted the Nazi Lowriders in ~1997. This started a war between the Nazi Lowriders and the Tijuana Cartel where that son was later ordered to stab a Tijuana Cartel [[Plaza Boss]] who lived on the border of [[San Diego]], Southern California and [[Tijuana]], [[México]] and who facilitated drugs and humans across the border of [[México]] and into the [[United States]]. The Nazi Lowriders traveled to [[San Diego]], [[Southern California]] and confronted that [[Tijuana Mexican Cartel]] [[Plaza Boss]] and the child that was molested stabbed that Tijuana Cartel Plaza Boss. This small war between the Nazi Lowriders and the Tijuana Cartel ended in a truce in ~2002. The son of one of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club was taken away from his family and placed in Child Protective Custody after his mother was seen in a shootout in [[Oildale]], [[California]] in ~1997. The local news stations responded to the incident.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus Texas Gangs and North Carolina Gangs In Northern Oildale===
In ~2008 the Nazi Lowriders are seen in a series of videos that show them fighting Non-Hispanic White Texas gang members and Non-Hispanic White North Carolina gang members who kept claiming to be members of the HA/AB
and were not. The videos show the Nazi Lowriders knocking on the door of one of the opponents where they walk into the apartment and proceed to anally rape that opponent. Another video shows the local '''Hells Angels''' chapter
of Oildale jacking off into a 1 gallon jug where they then proceed into the apartment and force that opponent to drink the 1 gallon of ejaculation. The opponents returned with more of their families in 2013 and they released
videos of themselves having anal sex with each other in order to confuse the querying of the original videos to make it look like they were in the '''Hells Angels''' if anyone looked it up. They're not.

The '''Vagos Motorcycle Club''' were also seen in the original video recorded in the area in ~2007.

These incidents were tied to the attempted infiltration of the U.S. Marines into the Nazi Lowrider Car Club from ~2006 and onward.

===Nazi Lowriders Versus U.S. Marines===
In 2005 the [[U.S. Marines]] attempted a covert infiltration of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club and the Nazi Lowrider Prison Gang by using the identity of the son of one of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club while they
drugged him.

The U.S. Marines are seen in several videos calling on the Nazi Lowriders in East Los Angles, Southern California and in the other recorded media the U.S. Marines are defeated by the Nazi Lowriders and the Sinaloa Cartel.

=Allegiances=
In ~1998 it was known and observed by the [[U.S. Navy]] that the 11 year old son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club spent several days talking privately with one of the highest ranking bosses of the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] in [[Southern California]] about the future politics of [[California]] and the future of [[Southern California]]. This son claimed to have been kidnapped and drugged by the [[U.S. Navy]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] at a later time. He has stated that he was kidnapped in plain site outside of [[South Gate]], [[Southern California]] with phony records by a woman from the [[U.S. Navy]] [[Seabees]] after they found out about his interactions with the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] Boss. He was placed on several California State and Kern County probations as a minor and as a minor his name was forcibly changed and concealed in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]]. The [[Kern County]] Juvenile Records belonging to the son of the founder of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club were sealed.

=Sources and Citations=
There are several inauthentic sources about the Nazi Lowriders that are available on the Internet that are used to cite statements here and elsewhere. The Nazi Lowriders did not start as a Neo-Nazi Gang or a Neo-Nazi Prison Gang and
the Nazi Lowriders have never operated outside of [[Southern California]] and they do not operate outside of [[Southern California]]. Literally stated: The Nazi Lowriders do not operate in any U.S. State or in any U.S. Territory exept
for the U.S. State of California. Some fraudulent and phony sources here claim that the Nazi Lowriders operate in the U.S. State of Texas, they don't. Another phony source claims that the Nazi Lowriders operate in the U.S. State of Florida, they don't. The U.S. State of Florida are lived in primarily by Haitain Bloods and the entire U.S. State of Florida are enemies of the U.S. State of California.
