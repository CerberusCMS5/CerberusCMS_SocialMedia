The '''Nazi Lowriders''' are a [[criminal syndicate]] and a '''Lowrider Car Club''' that are based in [[Southern California]] and are active in [[Southern California]]. '''Nazi Lowriders''' are also known collectively as '''The NLR''' and are also collectively known as '''The Ride''' of '''Nazi Lowriders'''.

==Origins==
'''Nazi Lowriders''' were formed in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] and in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] in the late 1960s as a gang of members who owned [[Chevy]] [[Lowrider]] vehicles with origins in the Southern California [[Lowrider]] [[Car Culture]] Community. They were first seen and documented by U.S. authorities on the border of [[East Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] and in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] in the mid [[1970s]].

The name of the gang was originally a play on words as being the most '''Racially Pure''' of the '''Hispanic Car Clubs''' in '''Southern California''' as the gang fought their enemy '''Hispanic Lowrider Gangs''' and overcame their rival '''Hispanic Lowrider Gangs''' in Southern California. The U.S. legal system in place in Southern California by invading [[Non-Hispanic White]] [[Population Groups]] favored the racially pure. The Nazi Lowriders did not start as a Neo-Nazi gang, they started as a Hispanic Car Club.

Nazi Lowriders formed their own [[Prison Gang]] in Southern California in the late [[1970s]] as they were incarcerated for street crimes and they later in [[1997]] formed a small alliance with the original members of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] of [[Southern California]]. The '''Nazi Lowrider''' [[Car Club]] and the '''Nazi Lowrider''' [[Prison Gang]] are the same and these entities were not founded by [[John Stinson]] or by the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and in fact the '''Nazi Lowriders''' existed in Southern California long before the founding of the '''Aryan Brotherhood''' in [[Southern California]]. The Nazi Lowriders were later formed as a White-Hispanic Car Club of Southern California in the late [[1960s]] and the [[1970s]].

Collected media and video footage in Southern California namely from [[Lowrider Magazine]] of Southern California as well as from video news reports from '''Video News Reporting Agencies''' in '''Los Angeles, Southern California''' show the '''Nazi Lowriders''' in '''street races''' near [[Boyle Heights]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] in the early [[1990s]] and in '''Lowrider Car Shows''' in [[Central Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] and near [[West Los Angeles]], [[Southern California]] in the mid [[1990s]] to the mid [[2000s]].

===History of California Immigration and Formation of Street Gangs===
[[Non-Hispanic White]] [[street gangs]] and [[African-American]] [[street gangs]] did not actually exist in Southern California before or during the arrival of Non-Hispanic Whites and African-Americans into [[Southern California]] and the waves of immigration of Non-Hispanic Whites into [[Southern California]] from the [[1920s]] to the [[1960s]]. [[Compton]], [[Los Angeles]] in Southern California was originally a Non-Hispanic White neighborhood from the [[1940s]] to the late [[1960s]] afterwhich a wave of [[African-Americans]] overtook the area and visibly formed a street gang known as the '''Cripps''' where then after the '''Bloods''' began as a new branch. The '''Bloods''' were originally a cultural part of the '''Cripps'''. The '''Cripps''' were slowly forced to move away from [[Compton]], [[Los Angeles]] in [[Southern California]] throughout the late [[1990s]] to the early to mid [[2000s]] while they were at occupational war with invading enemy Hispanic gangs. The '''Cripps''' gang were founded by [[Hispanics]] before they began recruiting African-Americans in the [[1970s]]. In the late [[1990s]] it was revealed to Los Angeles [[gangland]] that the '''Cripps''' were in fact formed by Hispanics while they used African-American gang members as a visible and showable force.

The primary waves of immigration of Non-Hispanic Whites and African-Americans into [[Southern California]] began after the [[1930s]] and included numerous waves of immigration of Non-Hispanic Whites from the Southern-Central United States. California State Law was previously ennacted to illegalize the immigration of any '''Americans''' from other U.S. States into California and [[Spanish California]] did not actually end socially until the early [[1900s]]. Every U.S. State west of the [[New England]] Colony States became a recognized and ratified U.S. State after the early to mid [[1900s]]. [[Oklahoma]] State for instance was not actually a recognized and ratified U.S. State until after [[1920]] because it was still called [[Indian Territory]] while the U.S. maintained efforts of colonizing [[Indian Territory]] and everything west of [[Indian Territory]] by [[White]] [[Settlers]]. The [[Dust Bowl]] of the areas of [[Oklahoma]] brought waves of Surviving [[American Indians]] as well as [[Non-Hispanic Whites]] from the areas known as [[Indian Territory]] into [[Southern California]] beginning in the mid [[1930s]]. While the U.S. encouraged expansion and settling in and further west of [[Indian Territory]] most of California safeguarded its territorial borders and restricted immigration. The dominating social force in '''California''' was known as the '''Californias''' and [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] was still primarily South-West American Indian that lived in and traveled in bands. Most American Indians of the South West moved away to areas in México after battling with the U.S. in the early [[1900s]].

In military terminology [[Occupation]] refers to [[agenda|agendized]] groups of people who literally move into the houses in the area or else into the area in order to take over the area while they go to war with the local population groups and move more allies into that area in order to own it in every way possible.

The primary waves of concentrated illegal immigration of Non-Latino Slav ( [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Armenians]], [[Eastern Europeans]] ) and Latino-Slav into California did not begin until the early to mid [[2000s]] as they began colonizing areas in Central America and South America and began traveling north to the borders of the U.S. and México.

===History and Origins In The Southern California Hispanic Lowrider Car Culture===
The phrase: '''Nazi Lowrider''' is a phrase that was [[coined]] by the founder of this [[Car Club]] as members of this [[Car Club]] went to war with their enemy gangs notably the gang known as the '''Cripps''' which is a word that is usually shortened to the word [[Crips]] and is a [[gang]] that was and is exclusively based in Southern California. The '''Nazi Lowriders''' also went to war with the '''Cripp''' counterpart gangs that are known as the [[Bloods]] all throughout the [[1980s]] in Southern California and later they went to war with the ''Cripp'' owned '''Car Club''' collectively known as the [[Druid Car Club]] all throughout the [[1990s]] and the early to mid [[2000s]]. Many of the original '''Cripp''' gang members were part [[Hispanic]] and or mixed with [[Hispanic]] and [[African]] heritage whereas the members of the '''Nazi Lowriders''' were more racially pure than all others out of all of the '''Lowrider Car Clubs''' in Southern California, hence the phrase: '''Nazi Lowrider'''.

The '''Cripps''' later formed more alliances with the '''Latin-American''' community in Southern California whereas the '''Nazi Lowriders''' formed more alliances with the existing [[Non-Hispanic White]] communities in Southern California and the existing [[White-Hispanic]] communities in Southern California.

The words [[Latino]] and [[Latina]] refer to people with Latin-American heritage. Latin-American countries are all of the countries that are south of the country of [[México]]. While [[Méxicans]] can be considered [[Hispanic]] because they speak a dialect of the language of [[Spanish]] not all [[Méxican]] [[Citizens]] or [[Méxican]] [[Nationals]] have origins from the country of [[México]] and many Méxicans have both [[American]] [[Indigenous]] and [[Spanish]] ( From [[Spain]] ) heritage whereas [[Californianos]] and [[Californianas]] which are technically multi-generational Californians and are people that descend from the era of [[Spanish California]]. [[Chicanos]] and [[Chicanas]] are a completely different Hispanic group.

===Unique Contributions To The Lowrider Car Culture of Southern California===
'''Nazi Lowriders''' contributed significant advancements to the '''Lowrider Car Culture''' of Southern California most notably the extended hydraulic suspension engineering schemes where some of their lowrider cars could extend up to 25 feet or more into the air where members could jump through second-story hotel and motel windows to fight enemies as well as to collect money and '''Nazi Lowrider' Lowriders''' that were seen between the [[1980s]] and the [[1990s]] were extremely unique. They also wrote advanced custom [[web application]] [[software]] from the late [[1990s]] to the mid [[2000s]] that could run from any [[Internet]] [[Web Browser]] where it would automatically resize itself
to any electronic device display resolution including from low budget mobile cell phone devices where any of the members could send messages to any other member to request pick up anywhere including by [[G.P.S. Location]], send orders, make [[VoIP]] phone calls and more. This was extremely useful for members to communicate long distance where S.M.S. and early social media limited communication speed. The web application software was also very useful for traveling through Los Angeles County, Southern California and Kern County, Southern California in groups.

===Banishment of Lowrider Vehicles===
In the [[1990s]] and the [[2000s]] in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]] as well as in different cities in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] numerous city officials within these counties banned '''Lowrider Racing Vehicles''' with [[hydraulics]] because the lowrider gangs could easily beat all of the [[Law Enforcement]] and the [[Military]] everywhere in [[California]] by using those engineered lowrider vehicles. Law Enforcement could not keep up with the speed of the '''Lowrider Racing Vehicles with Hydraulics''' and no one could hide from the [[maneuverability]] of those vehicles. Some '''Nazi Lowriders''' were known to have extended suspension hydraulics that could not be mimicked by other lowrider gangs where the entire vehicle could be raised sometimes up to 25 feet or more into the air with hydraulics as well as to tactically shield from enemy gun fire.

=Membership Requirements=
The original '''Nazi Lowriders''' required members to prove specific and [[rare]] [[Hispanic]] [[ancestral]] [[heritage]], but no [[Latin American]] heritage and no [[Negroid]] heritage. People with any [[Latin-American]] heritage were not allowed membership in the '''Nazi Lowrider Car Club''' or the '''Nazi Lowrider Prison Gang'''. '''Nazi Lowriders''' also required members to own a specific [[Chevy]] [[Vehicle]] with or without [[hydraulics]]. Lowrider Chevy vehicles were required in order to beat all of the street-level gangs without vehicles as well as to beat all of the rival Lowrider gangs. Members were also required to own a hand-gun so that member could engage in drive by shootings on their enemies from the lowrider vehicle. Hydraulics were later necessary in order to beat all of the enemies that hid in motels and hotels in Southern California as well as to tactically defend against gun fire from enemy gangs. Chevy vehicles that were manufactured between the 1960s to the late 1970s had extremely tough and high quality metals where [[.22]] [[caliber]] and [[.40]] [[caliber]] rounds could not penetrate through the metals if the vehicle doors and vehicle frames were reinforced with bullet proof goop and bullet proof mechanisms.

===Memorializatons===
All dead members of the Nazi Lowriders are remembered every year for their participation, gentrification efforts and more.

=Connections=
Nazi Lowriders are known to have connections with [[motorcycle clubs]] [[Vagos Motorcycle Club|Vagos Motorcycle Club]] of [[Southern California]] and [[Hells Angels Motorcycle Club|Hells Angels Motorcycle Club]] of [[Southern California]].

=Gentrification of Cities In Southern California=
Nazi Lowriders assisted in the [[gentrification]] of several cities in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] as well as of several cities in [[Kern County]], [[Southern California]]. Notably [[Oildale]], Southern California and [[East Bakersfield]], Southern California in [[Kern County]], Southern California throughout the [[1980s]] and the early to mid [[1990s]] as well as several cities in [[Los Angeles County]], [[Southern California]] notably [[South Gate]], [[Southern California]]. Nazi Lowriders assisted in these gentrifications because it was worth money. The Nazi Lowriders did not start as a [[Neo-Nazi]] gang, but it became known as one as it allied with a few Non-Hispanic White
gangs of [[Southern California]].

The film [[American History X]] was inspired by the stories of gentrification of [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]] and of [[Compton]], [[Southern California]] by a few fictitious families shown in the film where elements of
that fictitious family were based on real families residing in [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]] because [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]] is south of [[Compton]], [[Southern California]], but it was actually the Nazi Lowriders that paved the way for the Non-Hispanic Whites to move into [[Long Beach]], [[Southern California]] all throughout the [[1980s]] and the [[1990s]]. The original film shows this fictitious family moving to [[Venice]], [[Southern California]] after their experienced hardships.

This started a war between the Nazi Lowriders and the Tijuana Cartel where that son was later ordered to stab a Tijuana Cartel [[Plaza Boss]] who lived on the border of [[San Diego]], Southern California and [[Tijuana]], [[México]] and who facilitated drugs and humans across the border of [[México]] and into the [[United States]]. The Nazi Lowriders traveled to [[San Diego]], [[Southern California]] and confronted that [[Tijuana Mexican Cartel]] [[Plaza Boss]] and the child that was molested stabbed that Tijuana Cartel Plaza Boss. This small war between the Nazi Lowriders and the Tijuana Cartel ended in a truce in ~2002. The son of one of the founders of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club was taken away from his family and placed in Child Protective Custody after his mother was seen in a shootout in [[Oildale]], [[California]] in ~1997.
