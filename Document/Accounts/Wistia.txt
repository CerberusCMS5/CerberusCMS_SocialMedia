** Web Application Software Project History Video
- Short Project History Video and Demonstration Video For Cerberus Content Management System
I thought up Cerberus Content Management System around the year ~2000 after my relative gave me an original IBM Laptop.
My step-father Jesús ( ? ), the founding member of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club of Kern County, Southern California and of 
Los Angeles, Southern California wanted me to write the software so that he could use it to sell drug products as well as
to communicate with other Nazi Lowriders from the Internet in Bakersfield, Southern California.
The project could only be Pure Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor Programming Code with no JavaScript and all of the source code had to be visible from the web browser.
After we started the project I started writing it for the Vagos Motorcycle Club from the Internet in Bakersfield, Southern California.
We also extended this project to the Hells Angeles Motorcycle Club of Bakersfield, Southern California and of Long Beach, Southern California.
The web application project was officially registered on the Unix Registration Platform with the Unix Name: CerberusCMS from Bakersfield, Southern California.
