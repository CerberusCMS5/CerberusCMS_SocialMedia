** Web Application Software Project History Video
- Short Project History Video and Demonstration Video For Cerberus Content Management System
I thought up Cerberus Content Management System around the year ~2000 when I was 13 years old after my relative gave me an original IBM Laptop.
My step-father Jesus and my mother, some of the founding members of the Nazi Lowrider Car Club of Kern County, Southern California and of 
Los Angeles, Southern California wanted me to write the software so that he could use it to sell drug products as well as to communicate with other Nazi Lowriders from the Internet in Bakersfield, Southern California. This gave them an early advantange over enemy gangs. The original system package uploads can still be traced to 
my addresses in Oildale, Southern California from the years of ~2000 - 2003.

The project could only be Pure Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor Programming Code with no JavaScript and all of the source code had to be visible from the web browser.
After we started the project I started writing it for the Vagos Motorcycle Club from the Internet in Bakersfield, Southern California.
We also extended this project to the original Hells Angels Motorcycle Club of Bakersfield, Southern California and of Long Beach, Southern California of
the decades 50s to the beginning of the year 2000 as well as all of our allied gangs and allied car clubs.

This web application project was officially registered on the Unix Registration Platform with the Unix Name: CerberusCMS from Bakersfield, Southern California around 
the year ~2000-2001. I was taught computer programming from the Internet by a hacker in Western-Europe from the years of 2000 to 2006.
Now as of the year 2024 the project is around ~250,000 lines of Pure Pre-Hyper-Text-Post-Processor Programming Code and everything is usable directly from
any web browser from any electronic device at any video resolution and is 100% usable with JavaScript completely disabled. The reason for it to be usable
without JavaScript is so that the device connecting to it cannot be hacked by a few built-in backdoored JavaScript and HTML functions in the actual JavaScript Scripting Language itself
and the HTML Scripting Language itself, but not in my project programming code itself. The U.S. Government uses these functions to spy on everyone, but that could be good thing.

IF development of this web application software project continues it will be the fastest, snappiest and most digitially secure Content Management System out of all other platforms in 5 - 10 years from now
with a zero-trust system that rivals the U.S. Government.
